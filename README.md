# HiddenDevs
A dump of code for some of the systems I use in my example game.

All of the files shown in this repository are actively used in the game place provided in the Scripter Application.

Please note that the entire game is programmed by me, and I am the solo creator of any scripts located within it. (TreySoWavvy)


All of these scripts are written for a Star Wars game that can be found here: https://www.roblox.com/games/82597466486051/
